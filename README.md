HotPlate Online is a simple program that allows customers to order food online and have it delivered. At the moment, this program only works for Windows operating systems, but there are plans to expand to Android, IOS and MacOS. Software and illustrations was created by Andrew Collin (<a href = https://github.com/AndrewCollin32> Link </a>)

When you first open this program, you'll be greeted with the Main Store Page. On this page you can add your favorite food into the cart. There are multiple categories you can choose from for faster and more organized user experience. Once you add an item, the button will change color and the text will change to "add more". This means that you have 1 or more of this item in the cart. You can check your shopping cart or remove items by clicking on the shopping cart icon on the lower left. This will transfer you to the <a href = #Checkout_Page>Checkout Page</a>. On the main page, you also have access to your account information. Just click on the cat icon on the upper right and it will transfer you to the <a href = #User_Settings> User Settings </a>

This is the checkout page. On this page you'll enter your information to place an order. You can also edit your order to deleting them on the very left. Note that by deleting them, you are removing the entire item out of the basket, that means if you have 3 of the same item in the basket and you remove it, you'll remove all 3 of the items from the basket. You'll have to go back to the main page to add the item again.
